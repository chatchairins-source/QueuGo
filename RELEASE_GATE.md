# QueueGo Release Gate

Snapshot date: 2026-10-21 · Main: `c79640e0c896cc81961e8ba2dc69d336a9f519b0`

## Overall status

**NOT READY for a whole-platform production launch or Play Closed Testing claim.** Current main has working source and automated regressions, but the required real-user journey, physical-device/hardware evidence, Android signing and production cutover receipts are not all present. A green source test or CI run does not pass those gates.

## POS cash movement and inventory

- PR #568 merged after exact-head QueueGo RC [39622237860](https://github.com/chatchairins-source/QueuGo/actions/runs/39622237860) completed full `npm test`, Merchant WebKit, Admin/Merchant mobile, Map Lab/search and Grocery mobile/tablet checks. Merge commit: `c79640e0c896cc81961e8ba2dc69d336a9f519b0`.
- Production was inspected read-only after merge. Migration history ends at `20261021133330`; `pos_register_shifts` and `pos_register_cash_events` exist; cash-events RLS is enabled; anon SELECT and authenticated INSERT are denied; authenticated SELECT is allowed. Cash-events still has only `id,shop_id,shift_id,order_id,actor_id,amount,reason,created_at`; `event_type`, `idempotency_key` and `pos_record_cash_movement(text,numeric,text,uuid)` are absent. Therefore cash movement remains **NOT LIVE** despite its source merge.
- The PR #568 migration source and PGlite tests cover actor/shop/request serialization, exact-payload idempotency, cash direction, reason, permissions, till calculation and retry after close. This does not certify real simultaneous Production connections or cashier hardware.
- PR #572 was retargeted to main after #568 merged. Inventory source SHA `3ac73c2c1aa9221c392e5cfcaca5afd82653dd15` passed exact-source RC [39633575108](https://github.com/chatchairins-source/QueuGo/actions/runs/39633575108). Status-only checkpoint commits record the new base and evidence; fetch the live PR head before running the fresh exact-head RC now required after retarget.
- PR #572 stages four inventory migrations: SKU registry, authoritative options/pricing, generic reservation, and adjustment audit/history. Generic products use one reservation authority across POS/QR/Delivery; Grocery Master and Market ledgers are excluded. Production schema/security and real cashier/scanner/multi-channel acceptance remain BLOCKED; no inventory migration or live stock write has occurred.
- Supabase security/performance advisors were read on 2026-10-21. Findings include private RLS/no-policy tables and public API SECURITY DEFINER warnings requiring endpoint-by-endpoint intent review, plus unindexed foreign keys. These global findings were not treated as POS-specific failures or silently changed.

## Whole-platform gates

| Gate | Status | Evidence required |
|---|---|---|
| Current code and ancestry | PASS for this snapshot only | Fetch main, every relevant open PR and newest successor again before the next change |
| Full web automated regression | PASS for PR #568 exact RC; PR #572 source tree full npm test PASS | Run fresh exact-head RC on PR #572 after retarget and capture SHA |
| Exact-head hosted CI | PASS for #568 run `39622237860`; #572 source run `39633575108` pre-retarget | Fresh exact-head RC after #572 retarget remains OPEN |
| Migration and schema alignment | BLOCKED; read-only inspection confirms cash movement columns/RPC and all four inventory migrations absent | Review staged migration order, ACL/RLS, trigger order, recovery plan and Production compatibility; controlled apply only after authorized cashier/user acceptance |
| Authenticated role journeys | BLOCKED / incomplete | Real Customer→Merchant→Rider completed order; real cashier, owner and staff POS journeys with expected permissions and data scopes |
| Mobile lifecycle and physical hardware | BLOCKED | iOS/Android real device GPS/background/push plus actual POS printer, scanner, cash drawer and multi-terminal checks where used |
| Financial/payment provider | BLOCKED where applicable | Authorized provider credentials, signed webhook, duplicate/retry/settlement proof and owner-approved live test; no secrets in chat |
| Android release | BLOCKED | Current native successor exact CI, signed AAB verification, Data Safety/privacy/listing, Play Console Closed Testing and physical acceptance |
| Performance, accessibility and recovery | BLOCKED / incomplete | Mid-range device metrics, Thai text/font scaling/touch/focus, network loss, process death, restore and duplicate prevention evidence |
| Owner acceptance | BLOCKED for real-world items | Reviewable deployed build and recorded test evidence against `FEATURE_GAP_MATRIX.md` |

## Pass criteria

An individual feature can be marked `DONE (source/test)` only with its exact commit SHA and relevant local/hosted CI evidence. A feature is `DONE (deployed)` only after its approved deployment completes and the served/runtime bytes and behavior are verified. The platform is launch-ready only when all applicable role journeys and release evidence pass; unresolved gates stay `BLOCKED` with the exact required action.

## Production safety

- No test or fabricated records in Production.
- No production migration, provider activation, pricing change, feature-flag activation, public routing cutover or broad data mutation merely because CI is green.
- Preserve cash-first rules, shop-scoped POS records, existing refund ownership, and fail-closed dispatch/route-bundle limits.
- Record before/after schema or setting evidence without exposing secrets or personal data.
